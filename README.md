Still reading? Hey, yolo.

This is my latest attempt at a linting tool. For some reason I like spending time on this problem. It follows:

1. my [Python command-line tool](https://github.com/harveyr/lintblame),
1. my [Go command-line tool](https://github.com/harveyr/golintblame), and
1. my [webapp](https://github.com/harveyr/thunderbox).

**Why reinvent this wheel?**

1. Other linters can clutter up your editor with feedback. Particularly, for example, if you're editing a file written by someone who isn't a huge PEP8 fan.
1. I'm experimenting with combining git/hg blaming with the lint results, in order to highlight which style uglies *you* have made. Policing others' coding style is not always appreciated.
1. Because.

**Epic screenshot.**
