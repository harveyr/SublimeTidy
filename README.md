SublimeTidy
===========

This is an old plaything. Haven't touched it in years. Don't use it. Check out [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter).

**Epic screenshot.**

Each line with an issue gets a little dot. If you committed the line, it's a red dot. (Though the colors will vary depending on the color scheme.)

You can pull up the list of issues with a user-defined keyboard shortcut.
